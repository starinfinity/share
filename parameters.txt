    Demographic Features:
        Age: Older age is a risk factor for Type 2 diabetes.
        Gender: Gender can influence the risk of developing diabetes.
        Race/ethnicity: Some racial and ethnic groups have a higher risk of diabetes.

    Physiological Measurements:
        Blood Glucose Levels:
            Fasting blood glucose: Elevated levels can indicate diabetes or prediabetes.
            Postprandial blood glucose: Blood glucose levels 2 hours after a meal.
            Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): Provides an average blood sugar level over the past 2 to 3 months.
        Blood Pressure: Hypertension is a risk factor for diabetes.
        Body Mass Index (BMI): Overweight and obesity increase the risk of diabetes.
        Waist Circumference: Central obesity is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and diabetes.

    Medical History:
        Family history of diabetes: A family history increases one's risk.
        History of gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby weighing >9 lbs.
        Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): Women with PCOS are at an increased risk.
        Previous diagnosis of impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance.

    Lifestyle Factors:
        Physical activity: Sedentary lifestyle increases diabetes risk.
        Diet: High-calorie, high-sugar, and high-fat diets can contribute to obesity and insulin resistance.
        Smoking: It increases the risk of various diseases, including diabetes.
        Alcohol consumption: Both excessive and too little alcohol can have implications.

    Laboratory Tests:
        Triglyceride levels: Elevated levels are associated with insulin resistance.
        HDL cholesterol level: Low levels are associated with increased diabetes risk.
        Serum insulin levels: Can be used to determine insulin resistance.

    Other Health Conditions:
        Presence of autoimmune diseases.
        Previous cardiovascular diseases.
        Certain conditions like acanthosis nigricans.

    Medications:
        Use of certain medicines such as glucocorticoids, atypical antipsychotics, and certain antihypertensive drugs can influence glucose metabolism.

    Miscellaneous Features:
        Stress: Chronic stress can affect blood sugar levels.
        Sleep patterns: Both lack of sleep and excessive sleep can be risk factors.
